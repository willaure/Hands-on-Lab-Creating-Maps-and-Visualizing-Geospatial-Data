Hands-on Lab

Creating Maps and Visualizing Geospatial Data

Objectives

# After completing this lab you will be able to:

Create maps and visualize geospatial data with Folium

# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create maps for different objectives. To do that, we will part ways with Matplotlib and work with another Python visualization library, namely Folium. What is nice about Folium is that it was developed for the sole purpose of visualizing geospatial data. While other libraries are available to visualize geospatial data, such as plotly, they might have a cap on how many API calls you can make within a defined time frame. Folium, on the other hand, is completely free.
